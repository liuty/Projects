# Projects

# Fairness Resolution Study Project:

There exist numerous definitions of fairness in Machine Learning, and are typically addressed by optimizing a model for a particular fairness definition. In this project, we study the effects of optimizing for a particular fairness definition on alternate definitions of fairness.

# Human Learning Modeling Project:
Spaced, Massed, and Expanded Learning are well-studied human learning methods in psychology literature. This project attempts to model these methods using Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

# Image to Recipe Project:
The goal of this project is to be able to produce a recipe given an image of food. This project explores three different deep learning approaches for accomplishing this. 

# Mask Detection Project:
This project creates a system to detect face masks using computer vision, making use of some advanced computer vision techniques such as YOLO and Faster-RCNN.
