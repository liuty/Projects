#  Face Mask Detection

## Structure of the Code

We implemented 3 models (Faster-RCNN, SSD, YOLO) and Real-time Webcam Dectection. The codes are contained in each folder.

## Open Source Packages 

[pytorch](https://pytorch.org) - a famous framework for machine learning including numerous lines of code exist in the package

[numpy](https://numpy.org/) - a famous numerical computing tool including numerous lines of code exist in the package

[opencv](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) - a famous computer vision tool including numerous lines of code exist in the package

(Not quite sure about the requirements of this - URL of each of the open source packages used in your project and a description of each, including the size of the open source packages in # lines of code and the programming language, the open source)

## Datasets

* [Kaggle Face Mask Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection) 
  * images belonging to 3 classesWith_mask, mask_weared_incorrect, without_mask
  * Total Size: 388 MB
* [MaskedFace-Net Dataset](https://github.com/cabani/MaskedFace-Net) 
  * 60,000 images of correctly worn masksOver 60,000 images of incorrectly worn masks over chin or mouth-onlyComputer-generated
* Self-Collected Dataset
  * 86 images of volunteers (ie., friends) with hands covering face with hands or shirt

## Performance

We used Accuracy, Recall, Precision, Average Prediction Time to measure our models' ability. 

There is no hosting URLs of our project and you can run it locally or check the result run by ourselves in the notebooks in each folder.
